# Reports Information System for Pathology Labs
A web app for pathology labs that helps them in organizing reports efficiently.

Initially this project was developed for a client who runs a pathology lab in Delhi, India. This pathology lab conducts full body examination of candidates who are migrating to other countries. This project helped the lab in generating more than 4000 reports in the past six months. Recently another lab in Bihar (India), also bought a customized version of this project.

Although there are softwares available in the market for this purpose but they are bulky, difficult to use, hard on the eyes and they don't offer customizations. The client wanted a software which is customized to his requirements and can be accessed by multiple staff members at the same time without the hassle of any installation process.

This project act as a base setup for creating customized versions for different labs. 

#### [15th Dec 2021] New Updates

1. On some smartphones the QR code url for downloading reports was showing an error occured message. It was a cache related issue. Now whenever the report templates are updated, the app will ask user to reload the page to keep the Cache storage in sync.
2. Minor Design changes in report templates.
